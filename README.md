I may not disclose the source code of the projects I have worked on due to confidentiality reasons, and some of them are proprietary to the employers.

As a programmer, my expertise lies in web development and software engineering. I have worked on various web-based projects, ranging from building dynamic and interactive websites to developing backend systems and APIs. Throughout my career, I have gained proficiency in several programming languages, such as PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, depending on the project's requirements.

In the web development domain, I have experience with various frameworks and libraries, such as Codeigniter and ReactJS, which have allowed me to create responsive and scalable web applications. Additionally, I have worked with databases, both relational and NoSQL, to manage and store data efficiently.

While I cannot share specific code examples from my projects, I am more than willing to discuss my experiences, approaches, and the technologies I have utilized in my programming journey. If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to ask.
